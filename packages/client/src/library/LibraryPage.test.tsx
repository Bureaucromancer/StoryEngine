/**
 * **A hand edit reaches the browser without a restart** — the client half of P1
 * gate step 7–8, and [05 §4.1](../../../../docs/design/05-ui-surfaces.md)'s blunt statement of
 * the stakes: *if editing a file on disk does not reflect, the storage design
 * has already failed on its own terms.*
 *
 * The server half has been covered since P1 closeout —
 * `routes/gate.test.ts` › *step 8 — a hand edit reaches the browser without a
 * restart* polls the API with a real watcher running. Its own comment concedes
 * what it cannot reach: *"The client half — the 2s poll — is a component concern
 * and belongs with the jsdom tier."* That tier existed from P2.0 and nothing was
 * ever put in it, so **deleting `refetchInterval` from `useLibrary` left the
 * entire suite green while the project's headline demo stopped working.**
 *
 * Found by walking the P2 gate as a checklist rather than by a failure, which is
 * the only way a gap like this surfaces: there is nothing to go red.
