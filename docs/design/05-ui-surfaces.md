# 05 — UI surfaces

**Status: proposal.**

---

## 1. The client stance: web, and only web

**StoryEngine is a web application.** The browser is not *a* client, it is *the*
client. There is no desktop app, no Electron shell, no Tauri build, no native
mobile app, and no plan for any.

This is a stronger position than any of the three sources takes — Aventuras is a
Tauri desktop app, Marinara ships a launcher `.exe` plus Docker plus an Android
build, SillyTavern is a local server people reach in a browser but whose docs
treat that as a local-first arrangement. Hedging across shells is a real tax:
it forces filesystem access through an abstraction that has to work in three
environments, it doubles the packaging surface, and it makes the multi-user
server the *secondary* configuration in a product where it should be the only one.

What follows from this:

- **Responsive from day one**, because a phone browser is a real client. But
  "responsive and genuinely usable on a phone" is the 1.0 bar, not "designed
  phone-first". A *truly* mobile-optimised layout — different navigation model,
  different play surface, thumb-reachable controls — is a later, separate
  project, and it is a mode of the same web app, not a different artefact.
  (This is a deliberate softening of Marinara's "mobile is a first-class play
  surface" principle. Marinara is right for Marinara; a LAN server whose primary
  users are on laptops has different priorities at 1.0.)
- **No offline story.** No local cache-as-database, no sync. No service worker
  *for caching* — though a push-only one is permitted, and the distinction is
  drawn in [04 §3.4](04-server-multiuser-deployment.md).
  The server is on your LAN; if you can't reach it there is nothing to do.
  This removes an entire class of state-reconciliation problems.
- **Nothing is installed on the client.** Bookmark a URL. That is the whole
  install experience for everyone who isn't the person running the server.

The one legitimate secondary interface is **direct file access to the data
directory** — which is not a client at all, it's the storage design working as
intended. See §4.

## 2. Three peer surfaces

| Surface | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Play** | The three modes' chat/scene/adventure views |
| **Library** | Actors, lorebooks, settings, setups, presets, packages — browse, edit, organise, import, export |
| **Workbench** | What the engine sent, why, what it cost, and what to change |

"Peer" is a design-process claim as much as a layout one: Library and Workbench
get designed in the same pass as Play, not retrofitted once Play works. Both of
the source projects that have workbench-ish features arrived at them as debug
panels (Marinara's Injections tab is gated behind Debug mode; Aventuras'
`retrievalSnapshot` is annotated "Diagnostic only — nothing reads it back"), and
that origin shows.

---

## 3. Workbench

The turn record ([02 §8](02-data-model.md)) is designed to be displayed. The
workbench is its viewer and editor, and because the record is complete and
persistent, the workbench is a *reader*, not a second implementation of the
assembler. That is the whole trick.

What it shows for any turn, current or historical:

- **The block list**, in order, each with source, inclusion reason in plain
  language ("keyword match: *cathedral*", "sticky, 2 messages remaining", "party
  location == Rain City"), token cost, and included/dropped with the rule
  responsible. Marinara's `LorebookActivationSource` and its budget skip-reason
  reporting already produce most of this data
  ([02 §3.1–3.2](02-data-model.md)); the workbench is where it stops being an
  amber notice in a popover and becomes the primary view.
- **The budget verdict** — what the ceiling was, what was spent, what got
  dropped and what would drop next. "What is about to fall out of context"
  should be answerable *before* it happens.
- **The calls** — one per model call, with parameters, model, and the actual
  messages. Multiple calls for `per-actor` dispatch and for steps.
- **The effects** — proposed channel changes, which applied, which failed
  validation, which were overridden by an engine-computed rule.
- **Cost** — tokens and wall time for *this turn*, itemised by call, so "agents
  cost extra" is a number rather than a documentation note. This is displaying a
  field the record already holds. **Aggregate spend tracking is post-1.0**
  ([11 §3](11-roadmap.md)) — the people running this at the development stage
  are power users who already monitor their provider usage, and a usage
  dashboard is a very nice feature that is not core functionality.

What it lets you do:

- **Edit a block and re-run.** Marinara already does the important half of this:
  editing a saved agent snippet "changes only what is used when you regenerate
  that same reply. It does not change the reply already on screen." That
  separation is correct and should be preserved. Re-running follows the same
  rewrite/reroll distinction as an ordinary swipe
  ([07 §14.5](07-tech-stack.md)) and defaults to **rewrite** — editing a block
  is changing the input, not asking for different luck.
- **Diff two turns**, or the same turn before and after a preset change. The
  cheapest possible answer to "it got worse and I don't know what I changed".
- **Promote a dry run.** Assemble without sending, inspect, adjust, then send.
- **Keyword test, generalised.** Marinara's keyword-test panel — paste sample
  text, see which entries would fire — is excellent and currently applies to one
  lorebook's keyword rules only. As a workbench feature over the whole assembly,
  against a real session's channel state, it covers every activation source.

**[OPEN]** How much belongs in the play surface as a persistent affordance versus
a separate view. Something minimal and always visible — a context-fill meter,
clickable through to the full record — is probably right. A full workbench panel
beside every message is not.

---

## 4. File access as a permission level

The requirement, restated: since the data directory is the system of record and
is human-navigable by design ([02 §5](02-data-model.md)), a user with an account
on the server but no shell on the box should be able to reach their own files
*through the web UI*.

### 4.1 Why this fits rather than fights the architecture

It looks like a scary feature and mostly isn't, because of a decision already
made elsewhere: **the SQLite index is derived and rebuilt from a filesystem
watcher.**

That means a hand-edited file is not a special case. It is the same code path as
any other write — something changed on disk, the watcher notices, the object is
re-parsed and re-indexed. There is no "the UI wrote it so it's trusted / the user
wrote it so it's suspect" distinction, because the UI's writes go to disk and get
picked up the same way. A file browser is a view onto the truth rather than a
back door around it.

The corollary is that the feature is nearly free *if* the watcher path is correct,
and impossible to add safely if it isn't. Which makes it a useful design forcing
function even before it ships: **if hand-editing a file on disk doesn't work,
the storage design has already failed** on its own terms.

### 4.2 The permission

```ts
type FileAccess = "none" | "read" | "write"
```

One of the named account capabilities
([04 §4.2](04-server-multiuser-deployment.md)), admin-granted, default `none`.
Scoped roots, resolved and enforced server-side:

| Root | `read` | `write` |
|---|---|---|
| `/data/users/<own handle>/` | yes | yes — this includes their whole library |
| `/data/system/library/` | yes | never — app-shipped, and an update would overwrite edits anyway |
| `/data/system/connections/` | **never** | never — system connections are usable, not readable ([04 §4.5](04-server-multiuser-deployment.md)) |
| `/data/users/<other>/` | never | never |
| `/data/config.json`, `/data/index/` | never | never |

Simpler than an earlier draft, because there is no shared library to gate
separately ([04 §4.3](04-server-multiuser-deployment.md)): a user's roots are
their own directory, and everything in it is theirs to break.

Two exclusions worth stating explicitly, both about credentials:

- **The user's own `connections/`** is within their writable root, which is
  defensible — they are that user's own keys — but the file browser should still
  refuse to *display* the contents, so a shoulder-surfer or a screen share does
  not reveal a key the UI otherwise only ever shows masked.
- **`system/connections/` is excluded outright**, and this is the one place the
  system scope is *not* readable the way `system/library/` is. System
  connections are usable, never readable
  ([04 §4.5](04-server-multiuser-deployment.md)) — an admin who wants to inspect
  one has shell access to the box, which is the right gate.

### 4.3 What it is, concretely

A file manager: tree, upload, download, rename, move, delete, and a text editor
for the JSON kinds with schema validation on save. Plus — the actually
useful part — **download a folder as a zip** and **upload a zip into place**,
which is the drag-and-drop export/import story working through a browser for
people who can't reach the disk directly.

Notably *not*: executing anything, following symlinks out of the roots, or
touching binary card payloads with a text editor (offer download/replace
instead).

### 4.4 What it costs

Honest accounting, because the user is right that this is a pain:

- **Path handling is where this class of feature always breaks.** Every path
  must be resolved to a real path and re-checked against the allowed roots after
  resolution, symlinks that escape rejected, and `..` handled by resolution
  rather than by string inspection. Windows adds ADS, reserved device names, and
  case-insensitivity to the list. This is well-understood but unforgiving, and it
  wants one audited helper that every route uses rather than per-route checks.
- **Users will break things.** A malformed lorebook, a card PNG with a corrupt
  chunk, a deleted folder a session was seeded from. The answer is that
  validation failures are *visible and inert*: the object appears in the library
  flagged invalid with the parse error shown, and nothing crashes, hides it, or
  silently rewrites it. That behaviour is needed anyway for hand-edited-on-disk
  files and for imports, so the file browser doesn't create the requirement.
- **Upload is an attack surface** even among trusted users: size limits, no
  archive traversal on zip extraction (`zip-slip`), no execute bits, and content
  sniffing rather than trusting extensions.
- **It is not a 1.0 feature.** Recommendation: define the permission field and
  the scoped-root helper in the initial auth work so the shape exists, ship
  read-only download-and-zip early because it is cheap and immediately useful,
  and defer write and the text editor to 1.x.

**[OPEN]** Whether `write` should require re-entering the password, the way
admin actions sometimes do. Probably overkill given the threat model in
[04 §4.1](04-server-multiuser-deployment.md), but worth one conversation.

---

## 5. Library

Browse, search, tag, folder, favourite, filter, bulk select, import, export,
duplicate. All three sources converged on roughly this and there is no reason to
be inventive.

Where it should differ:

- **One library surface for all portable kinds**, with a kind filter — not five
  panels behind five buttons. ("Portable" as in exportable
  ([13 §1](13-schemas.md)); libraries themselves are per-user and nothing is
  shared between accounts on one install.)
- **The user's library and the system library render as one list**, with a
  source badge and a filter, not as two panels. Hunting in two places to find a
  character is worse than a badge. Read-only system objects show a **Copy to my
  library** action in place of edit — which forks a real copy they own
  ([04 §4.3](04-server-multiuser-deployment.md)). Objects link across kinds constantly and the
  cross-links should be navigable inline.
- **Links are visible and bidirectional.** From a lorebook: which settings,
  actors and packages reference this. From an actor: which lorebooks it links.
  Missing links show as missing, inline, non-blocking ([00 §3.3](00-stance.md)).
- **The disk layout is legible.** Since the folder *is* the object, show the path
  and — for users with file access — link straight into the file browser at that
  location. This is a rare case where exposing the storage mechanism is the
  feature: it is how a user learns that drag-and-drop export works at all.
- **Export produces one file**, not a folder the user has to zip themselves
  ([02 §5.2.3](02-data-model.md)) — singly and in bulk. On disk everything stays
  a folder; the single-file form exists for exchange only.
- **Import is a review step, not a modal that dumps.** Show what was recognised,
  what went to `compat`, what resolved, what dangled, and let the user fix it
  before committing.

---

## 6. Setup flows

Both sources use wizards and both wizards are good. Worth taking:

- **From Aventuras:** the seed → AI expand → edit → accept loop for setting
  creation, including `useSettingAsIs()` — the escape hatch that skips expansion
  entirely. The expansion is an assist, not the path.
- **From Marinara:** every step but the first has a working default, and the
  wizard is skippable into the settings drawer. "Only the connection is
  required" is the right bar.
- **From Marinara:** the immutable setup snapshot, so a good combination can be
  shared *after* playing rather than by remembering to record it beforehand. Here
  it is stronger, because the snapshot is a real **Setup** object
  ([13 §7](13-schemas.md)) rather than a text file — editable, re-runnable, and
  shareable by dropping it in a package.

Where it differs: **the wizard is declared, not coded.** `ModeDefinition.setup`
([03 §2](03-modes-and-turn-pipeline.md)) is a schema the shell renders, so an
extension mode gets a first-class setup flow without writing UI. Aventuras' pack
`CustomVariable` — typed, enum options, required flag, defaults, sort order, help
text — is a working precedent and close to the right vocabulary.

---

## 7. The assistant surface

Specified in [03 §7.4](03-modes-and-turn-pipeline.md), which covers why it is a
session rather than a bespoke thing. The UI side:

- **Summonable from anywhere**, including mid-session, without losing your
  place. A panel rather than a route.
- **Two scales of help, deliberately distinct.** The in-editor field assist
  ([§11](#11-editors-are-not-dumb-forms)) is for *this field*; the assistant is
  for "help me work out what I'm doing". Both should exist and neither should
  try to be the other — a refine box that opens a chat is annoying, and an
  assistant that can only rewrite one field is useless.
- **Starter prompts on an empty assistant**, per Marinara's suggestion chips.
  The gap between a blank input and knowing what to ask is most of why in-app
  assistants go unused.
- **Proposed changes render as diffs**, reviewed and applied explicitly, never
  written silently.
- **Show what it can see.** The ambient context — which actor is open, which
  session you came from — belongs on screen, not just in the turn record.

---

## 8. Extension-contributed UI

Resolved here because it is what decouples the frontend framework choice from
everything else (see [07 §6](07-tech-stack.md)).

**Extensions do not ship UI components.** They declare widgets from a versioned
vocabulary that the host renders: HUD widgets, side panels, message decorations,
input-bar actions, setup form fields, library columns. Marinara's HUD widget
specs and Aventuras' `RuntimeVariable` display metadata (colour, icon, pinned,
min/max) are both evidence that the declarative vocabulary covers the real cases.

This buys three things: extensions cannot break the app's rendering, the
frontend framework stays a reversible decision, and an extension written today
still works after a framework upgrade.

**[OPEN]** The escape hatch for an extension that genuinely needs custom
rendering — a map, a card table, a graph. Sandboxed iframe with a narrow
postMessage API is the obvious answer and it is a real chunk of work. Deferring
is fine; pretending the vocabulary will cover everything forever is not.

---

## 9. In-app notification, and sounds

The client half of [04 §3](04-server-multiuser-deployment.md). Routing is
server-side; the client renders sound, toast, unread badges and the document
title.

- **Distinct sounds per event class**, not one generic chime. Turn-complete,
  message-received, awaiting-input and failed should be tellable apart from
  another room — which is the entire point of having a sound rather than a
  toast. Per-class volume, a global mute, and a start-muted preference
  (Marinara's, worth copying).
- **Prime the audio on first interaction.** Browsers block audio until a user
  gesture has occurred, so the *first* completion sound after a page load is
  silently dropped unless an audio context was unlocked by an earlier click.
  This is a well-known trap that presents as "sounds work sometimes", and the
  fix — unlock on the first interaction of the session — has to be deliberate.
- **Suppress what is already visible.** A toast for a message rendering in the
  session you are looking at is noise. The sound is still wanted; the toast is
  not.
- **Unread state belongs to the server**, so it survives a reload and is
  consistent across a phone and a laptop open at once. Marinara's floating
  avatar bubble for a message in an unviewed chat is a good pattern, and it
  collapses on mobile rather than stacking.

**[OPEN]** Whether per-actor notification sounds are worth it in Messages mode —
knowing *who* messaged without looking is genuinely useful, and it is one more
thing to configure per card.

---

## 10. The guidance box

Every session input carries an expandable guidance box, collapsed and empty by
default, specified in [03 §5.1](03-modes-and-turn-pipeline.md). It is the
supported place for "keep this short", "focus on Vera's reaction", "don't
resolve the fight yet" — the meta-instruction people currently smuggle in as
`(OOC: …)` inside their action.

UI notes:

- **Collapsed by default, and visibly empty when collapsed.** A guidance box
  that silently retains last turn's text becomes a standing instruction by
  accident, which is exactly what [03 §5.1](03-modes-and-turn-pipeline.md) says
  it must not be. Clear on send.
- **[OPEN]** Offer the previous guidance as a one-click refill. Convenient for
  repeated nudges, and one step from the accidental-standing-instruction
  problem. Probably worth it as an explicit recall action rather than a
  persisted value.
- **Show it in the turn record.** It was an input to that turn and belongs in
  the workbench block list like any other, marked advisory.
- **The `advisory` marker should be visible**, not just internal. A user typing
  "she fails the check" into the box should be able to see that this text
  reached the narrator and not the resolver — otherwise the guarantee in
  [03 §5.2](03-modes-and-turn-pipeline.md) is invisible and nobody trusts it.

---

## 11. Editors are not dumb forms

A cross-cutting requirement, and one that has to be decided early precisely
*because* it is cross-cutting. Two capabilities belong to **every** editor in
the application, not to particular ones:

1. **Every text field can be generated, refined and reverted** — Aventuras'
   pattern, applied everywhere rather than only in the wizard.
2. **Every image slot can be generated, uploaded, cropped and replaced** —
   Marinara's in-UI crop, available wherever an image can appear.

Retrofitting these field by field produces exactly what all three sources have:
assistance in the two or three places someone got round to, and a plain textarea
everywhere else. They should be **primitives the editors are built from**, so
that "does this field have AI assist?" is never a question anyone asks.

### 11.1 The field assist contract

Four operations on any text field:

- **Generate** — write this field from nothing.
- **Refine** — rewrite it against a free-text guidance string. Aventuras'
  `refineSetting(guidance)` with its `settingElaborationGuidance` box is the
  model, and the guidance box matters: "make it darker" is the whole interaction,
  and without it the only recourse is regenerate-and-hope.
- **Revert** — back to the value before the assist ran, and separately back to
  the generated original after manual editing. Aventuras keeps
  `previousExpandedSetting` for exactly the first of these.
- **Accept as-is** — the escape hatch. Aventuras' `useSettingAsIs()` skips
  expansion entirely and takes the raw seed. Nothing may *require* a model call
  to proceed, ever.

**Context is the part that gets skimped.** "Generate an appearance" must see the
actor's name, summary, tags and the setting it is being authored against. An
assist that receives only the field label produces generic slop and trains
people not to use it. The assist call therefore needs a context builder over the
object being edited and its links — which is a small, reusable thing, but it is
real work and it is why this must be a primitive rather than a per-field bolt-on.

### 11.2 Provenance, taken from Marinara

Marinara's scenario work already has the persistence half of this, and it is
right:

```ts
interface GeneratedFieldProvenance {
  original: string      // the generated value, JSON-encoded for non-string fields
  at: string            // ISO timestamp
  model: string | null
  seed: string | null   // the input the generation ran from
}
```

…stored as a map keyed by dotted field path (`"setting.themes"`). Adopt it.

It buys three things, the third of which is the interesting one:

- Revert-to-generated after hand editing.
- Honest disclosure — "this was model-written, from this prompt, with this
  model."
- **A library-wide view of what is authored and what is machine-written.** In a
  library that has grown by generation, "which of these characters did I
  actually write?" becomes answerable. No source offers this, and it is a real
  trust feature rather than a novelty.

### 11.3 Image slots

Wherever an image can appear — actor avatar, sprites, gallery, setting cover,
lorebook entry art, package cover — the same four affordances: **upload,
generate, crop, replace.**

**Cropping is non-destructive at the editing layer.** Marinara stores a
normalised source rectangle rather than baking the crop into pixels:

```ts
interface SourceRectAvatarCrop { srcX, srcY, srcWidth, srcHeight }  // 0..1 of source
```

Normalised coordinates survive the source being resized or re-encoded, which is
the reason to prefer them over pixel offsets. Marinara also keeps a legacy
zoom+offset variant as a *render-only* compatibility path so old crops display
unchanged until re-edited — a good pattern to copy when this format inevitably
changes.

**One tension to resolve deliberately, because our storage decision creates it.**
[02 §5.2](02-data-model.md) makes `card.png` canonical *and* requires that
dragging it out yields a usable character in another tool. A crop stored only as
metadata means other tools render the uncropped source — often badly framed,
sometimes absurdly. That undercuts the interop commitment we already made.

So, for actor cards specifically:

- **The card's pixels are the cropped result.** That is what other tools will
  show, so it must be the portrait as intended.
- **The uncropped source is retained** in the actor's `assets/`, with the crop
  rectangle in the card JSON, so re-cropping is lossless and reversible.

Destructive for interop, non-destructive in substance. Cropping never costs you
the original.

### 11.4 An architectural note: not every model call is a turn

Everything up to here has assumed the turn pipeline is the only path to a model.
Field assists and image generation in the library are a **second call path**,
running outside any session, and that has three consequences worth stating
before they are discovered:

- **They need a connection**, and it should not silently be the chat one. This
  is what `ModelHint.role` ([02 §2.6](02-data-model.md)) is for — assist work
  wants the `fast` role, image work wants an image connection, and a household
  server needs those resolvable per user.
- **They cost money, and must be *recorded* even though nothing displays it at
  1.0.** Recording is nearly free and cannot be added retroactively — a spend
  view built later over data that was never captured shows nothing for the first
  year. So capture assist-call cost from the start and leave the aggregate view
  to [11 §3](11-roadmap.md).
- **They produce no turn record.** §8.2's provenance is the record, which is
  another reason it is not optional.

### 11.5 Traps

- **Never auto-generate.** Not on field focus, not on blur, not on opening an
  empty editor. User-initiated only. An editor that fills itself in is an editor
  people stop trusting.
- **Never block on the model.** Every field stays directly typeable while an
  assist is running or failing.
- **Refine must be cheap to reject.** One click back to the previous value, no
  confirmation dialogue.
